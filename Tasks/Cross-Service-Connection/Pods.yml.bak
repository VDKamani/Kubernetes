# First we will create 2 namespace 1 is stage and second is prod
# then 1 pod in stage and 1 pod in prod namespace
# then we will create a service in stage and a service in prod namespace
# pod of stage is connected to service of stage namespace
# pod of prod is connected to service of prod namespace
# now again we will create a pod in stage namespace and a pod in prod namespace
# now pod in stage namespace is connected to existing service of prod namespace
# and pod in prod namespace is connected to existing service of stage namespace
